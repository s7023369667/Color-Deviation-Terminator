# Color-Deviation-Terminator
This was the IoT project in the IoT class.

We made a color detecter to correct the specific "Color Codes" which is the special "RGB value" for a particular application.

Our goal is to find out the color different after we use the color sensor to detect the pictures with those specific "Color Codes",

After we find out the color different we caculate the distance that we need to modified from each R,G,B channel.

Hope we could make the user printout  the right pictures with the specific "Color Codes".


How we ask bot doing things for us :

Step1 : 
You could use "hi" to get "start" or "help".

Step2: 

You will be ask to input the "R G B" which will be the specific "Color Codes" that you want to find out the color different from the "color code", and you will get a colored picture by using your color code.

Step3:

You ask "result" to get the caculation of the color difference, and it gives each channel the specific color distance.
You get the "result" and you could correct your printout.
