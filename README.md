# Color-Deviation-Terminator
This is the IoT project in the IoT class.

We made a color detecter to correct the specific "Color Codes" which is the special "RGB value" for a particular application.

Our goal is to find out the color different after we use the color sensor to detect the pictures with those specific "Color Codes",

After we find out the color different we caculate the distance that we need to modified from each R,G,B channel.

Hope we could make the user printout  the right pictures with the specific "Color Codes".
